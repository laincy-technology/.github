# Laincy Technology
Laincy is a technology organization aiming to provide privacy-first alternatives to popular technologies. We do this through open-source software meant to be used in various places. The software is programmed in a way that's meant to be incredibly fast and performant so that users can adapt it to any existing hardware, for example, a Raspberry pi. In the future we plan to manufacture and sell our custom boards and devices that are built using our open-source software.
