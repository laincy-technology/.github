Laincy is a technology organization aiming to provide privacy-first alternatives to popular technologies. We do this through open-source software meant to be used in various places. The software is programmed in a way that's meant to be incredibly fast and performant so that users can adapt it to any existing hardware, for example, a Raspberry pi. In the future we plan to manufacture and sell our custom boards and devices that are built using our open-source software.
## Current Projects
### Home Ecosystem
Laincy Home is a project for the creation of a private home IoT network. Its core is a custom-coded rust kernel designed to be run on inexpensive single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W that we've been using in development. Outside of that, we plan on creating libraries for several languages that allow the creation of custom IoT devices.
